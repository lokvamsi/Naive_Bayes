Binary Naïve Bayes

We used a binary approach to word frequencies for each document.

Measures of performance:

For class 1 (positive ratings):

•	Accuracy on testing data: 83.16%

•	Precision on testing data: 84.239%

•	Recall on testing data: 81.584%

•	F measure: 82.89%

For class 2 (negative ratings):

•	Accuracy on testing data: 83.16%

•	Precision on testing data: 82.146%

•	Recall on testing data: 84.736%

•	F measure: 83.421%

Naïve Bayes with stop word elimination

We nullified the frequencies of ‘stop-words’. The stop words were decided based on ‘Default English Stop words list’ from the website.

Measures of performance:

For class 1 (positive ratings):

•	Accuracy on testing data: 83.188%

•	Precision on testing data: 83.00%

•	Recall on testing data: 83.472%

•	F measure: 83.235%

For class 2 (negative ratings):

•	Accuracy on testing data: 83.188%

•	Precision on testing data: 83.377%

•	Recall on testing data: 82.904%

•	F measure: 83.14%
